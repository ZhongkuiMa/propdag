# propdag: Bound Propagation of Directed Acyclic Computation Graphs for Neural Network Verification

This is a framework to develop bound propagation approaches for neural network verification.

## Usage

- `progdag/template`: Some template classes for bound propagation.
- `propdag/toy`: A toy implementation of bound propagation.

### Install dependencies

You only need a Python>=3.10. There is no special requirement for the third-party packages.

### Testing Example

`test` folder contains examples to try the framework.
